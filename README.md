# README

This is the repository for `repair-workstation`.

## What is this?

This is my IB CS IA, but I'm developing this to be actually used in the Repair Workshop service

## Important things to note:

This program requires an SQL database. I will write notes on how to set one up with the correct specifications

Also, one of the files in the `.gitignore`, `src/mysql_server_key` is the **<u>SQL SERVER KEY!</u>** Make sure to fill this in with your instance.



The following is auto-generated by VSC:

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
